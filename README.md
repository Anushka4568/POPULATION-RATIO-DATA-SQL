# Employment & Population Ratio in India (1961â€“1988)

This project explores employment trends and population ratios in India from 1961 to 1988 using data sourced from [WorldData](https://www.worlddata.info). I cleaned the raw data in Excel, structured it into a PostgreSQL table, and ran multiple queries to understand employment patterns across industries, genders, and age groups.

## ðŸ“‚ Files in This Repository
- `population_ratio_data.sql`: SQL dump of the cleaned and structured data table (`popudata`)
- `queries.sql`: SQL queries for exploring and analyzing the dataset (to be added)

## ðŸ§  What I Did
- Collected raw data from a public source
- Cleaned and structured the data in Excel
- Imported the cleaned CSV into PostgreSQL
- Wrote and executed SQL queries:
  - Aggregate functions: `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, 'ORDER BY()', ;AVG()'
  - Filtering using `WHERE` clauses
  - Extracting trends based on gender, age, and employment sector
